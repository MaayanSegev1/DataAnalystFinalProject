# DataAnalystFinalProject

Project end of course "Introduction to Data Analyst"
project by Amit Yona and Maayan Segev

Our project deals with the study of the question: Estimating the market value of football players in future transfers between clubs, 
in accordance with the research data and characteristics that are based on data from FIFA (International Football Federation)

Research sub-questions:
1. Mark which player traits lead to a player's high value
2. In which league are the most valuable players
3. Does the value of a transaction made on a particular player match the value of his abilities (the value of the player was closest to the amount paid for him according to machine learning prediction)
4. What was the most lucrative transfer / transaction (the amount paid for a player was lower than the projected value)?
5. What was the least profitable transfer / transaction (the amount paid for a player was the highest of the projected value)
6. Is it possible to predict that a particular player will break out
